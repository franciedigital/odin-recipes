# Odin Recipes

Welcome to Odin Recipes! This project is a simple recipe website where you can find various delicious recipes to try out in your kitchen. Each recipe page contains detailed instructions, ingredients lists, and images of the finished dishes.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of two main components:

1. **index.html**: This is the main landing page of the website. It contains a list of recipe links where users can navigate to find specific recipes.
